# Marksie Issues

This Repository is used as a centrally managed issue tracker for the Marksie bot.

## Usage

As with any issues, please follow these rules to ensure your issue gets tracked and resolved expediently:

1. Please ensure your issue is clearly described.
   * **Don't:** put "The bot isn't running!" as an issue! We're currently working on a status system for this.
2. Please utilize the issue templates we've provided!
   * This makes it easier to get your problems resolved, your feature requests evaluated, and your happiness increased! (or something)
3. If all else fails or does not suffice for your use-case, please use the contact form below.
   * A response is not guaranteed, but you can expect a **minimum** of 24 hours to evaluate form responses received.
